Apllication of list sorting and finding missing number.

Sorting:1

In the listsort folder there are two files list_sort.py and list_sort_test.py, list_sort_test.py includes minimGiven a list containing integers, floats and one character strings, write a function that takes a list and returns a dictionary with keys evens, odds, and chars. The value for evens is a list of sorted even numbers, the value for odds is a list of sorted odd numbers and chars is a list of sorted character strings.  
list_sort([2,0,6,5,1,7,’z’,’a’])   # returns {‘evens’: [0,2,6], odds: [1,5,7], chars:[‘a’,’z’]}

al tests for the challenge, implement list_sort() in list_sort.py to pass all the tests. Feel free to write more tests.
How to run the tests: Navigate to the listsort folder in the terminal(command prompt) and run “pytest”( type pytest and press enter).
